# Hover Tooltip Enhancement Summary

## What Was Added

Enhanced the hover tooltips to show **detailed confidence score breakdowns**, making the draft detection system completely transparent.

## Implementation

### 1. New Interfaces (`src/draftDetector.ts`)

```typescript
export interface ConfidenceBreakdown {
    baseScore: number;
    naturalLanguageScore: number;
    incompleteLaTeX: boolean;
    multiLine: boolean;
    hasFormattedLaTeX: boolean;
    isShortText: boolean;
    factors: string[];        // Human-readable positive factors
    penalties: string[];      // Human-readable penalties
}

export interface DraftRegion {
    range: vscode.Range;
    text: string;
    type: 'typed' | 'pasted';
    confidence: number;
    breakdown?: ConfidenceBreakdown;  // NEW!
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Confidence Calculation

Added `calculateDraftConfidenceWithBreakdown()` method that returns both:
- The confidence score (0-1)
- A detailed breakdown of how it was calculated

**Factors tracked:**
- ✅ Natural language percentage
- ✅ Incomplete LaTeX (+30%)
- ✅ Multi-line text (+10%)
- ⚠️ Formatted LaTeX penalties (sets to 20%)
- ⚠️ Short text penalty (sets to 30%)

### 3. Rich Hover Tooltips (`src/draftVisualizer.ts`)

Created `createHoverMessage()` method that generates markdown tooltips showing:

```
### 🟢 High Confidence Draft (85%)

**Type:** ⌨️ Typed

#### Confidence Calculation:

**Positive Factors:**
- ✅ Natural language: 75% (×0.6 = 45%)
- ✅ Multi-line (4 lines) +10%
- ✅ Incomplete math ($...) +30%

_Final score = 85% (capped at 100%)_

---

💡 **Press Enter 3 times** to convert to LaTeX
```

## Features

### Visual Indicators

- **🟢 Green header**: High confidence (≥60%)
- **🟡 Yellow header**: Low confidence (40-60%)
- **⌨️ Typed** or **📋 Pasted**: Content source
- **✅ Checkmarks**: Positive factors that increase confidence
- **⚠️ Warnings**: Penalties that decrease confidence
- **💡 Tip**: Action to take (conversion instructions)

### Confidence Breakdown Components

1. **Positive Factors** (when present):
   - Natural language score with calculation
   - Incomplete LaTeX detection
   - Multi-line bonus

2. **Penalties** (when present):
   - Formatted LaTeX detection
   - Short text warning
   - High command density

3. **Explanatory Notes**:
   - Why the score is what it is
   - What the final capped score means

## User Benefits

### 1. Transparency
Users can now see **exactly** why text is classified as a draft:
- "Natural language: 75%" - I can see the system detected mostly natural text
- "Incomplete math ($...)" - System noticed I didn't close the dollar sign
- "Contains \begin{}\end{}" - Ah, that's why it's not highlighted as draft

### 2. Learning
Users learn what makes good draft text:
- Natural language scores higher
- Incomplete LaTeX is a strong draft indicator
- Multi-line text gets a bonus
- Formatted commands indicate non-draft

### 3. Debugging
When something doesn't work as expected:
- Hover shows why confidence is low
- Can adjust writing or settings accordingly
- Clear visibility into the decision-making

### 4. Trust
Complete transparency builds user confidence:
- No "black box" - everything is explained
- Can verify the logic makes sense
- Understand edge cases

## Examples

### Example 1: High Confidence Draft

**Input:**
```
need to add proof here
basically use induction on n
```

**Hover shows:**
```
🟢 High Confidence Draft (70%)
Type: ⌨️ Typed

Positive Factors:
✅ Natural language: 100% (×0.6 = 60%)
✅ Multi-line (2 lines) +10%

Final score = 70%
```

### Example 2: Incomplete LaTeX Boost

**Input:**
```
the equation is 2x + 5 = $
```

**Hover shows:**
```
🟢 High Confidence Draft (90%)
Type: ⌨️ Typed

Positive Factors:
✅ Natural language: 100% (×0.6 = 60%)
✅ Incomplete math ($...) +30%

Final score = 90%
```

### Example 3: Formatted LaTeX Penalty

**Input:**
```latex
\begin{theorem}
For all $n \geq 1$...
\end{theorem}
```

**Hover shows:**
```
🟡 Low Confidence Draft (20%)
Type: 📋 Pasted

Penalties:
⚠️ Contains \begin{}\end{}

Note: Contains formatted LaTeX, likely not a draft
```

## Code Changes

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/draftDetector.ts`**:
   - Added `ConfidenceBreakdown` interface
   - Updated `DraftRegion` to include breakdown
   - Added `calculateDraftConfidenceWithBreakdown()`
   - Updated all draft region creation to include breakdown

2. **`src/draftVisualizer.ts`**:
   - Added `createHoverMessage()` method
   - Enhanced tooltip generation with markdown formatting
   - Added emoji indicators and structured layout

### Files Created:

- **`HOVER_TOOLTIPS.md`**: Complete documentation with examples

### Files Updated:

- **`README.md`**: Mentioned hover tooltips in features
- **`QUICK_REFERENCE.md`**: Added hover tooltip details

## Testing

### To Test:

1. **Open a LaTeX file and save it** (Cmd/Ctrl+S)

2. **Type natural language:**
   ```
   need to add proof here
   basically use induction
   ```
   - Should highlight green
   - Hover shows natural language score + multi-line bonus

3. **Type with incomplete math:**
   ```
   equation is x = $
   ```
   - Should highlight green
   - Hover shows incomplete math +30% bonus

4. **Paste formatted LaTeX:**
   ```latex
   \begin{equation}
   x = 5
   \end{equation}
   ```
   - Should not highlight (or yellow if close to threshold)
   - Hover shows penalties for formatted LaTeX

5. **Type short text:**
   ```
   add here
   ```
   - Should show low confidence or no highlight
   - Hover shows short text penalty

## Technical Details

### Calculation Logic

```
Base Score = Natural Language Score × 0.6

Bonuses:
+ Incomplete math: +0.3
+ Multi-line (>2 lines): +0.1

Penalties (override base):
- Formatted LaTeX (begin/end, sections, high density): = 0.2
- Short text (<10 chars): = 0.3

Final = min(1.0, Base + Bonuses)
```

### Natural Language Score

```
Natural Language Score = 
    (Sentences with <30% LaTeX commands) / (Total sentences)
```

### Breakdown Tracking

The system tracks:
- **Base score**: Final calculated confidence
- **Natural language score**: Percentage of natural sentences
- **Boolean flags**: incomplete LaTeX, multi-line, formatted LaTeX, short text
- **Factor strings**: Human-readable descriptions of bonuses
- **Penalty strings**: Human-readable descriptions of penalties

## Performance

- **Minimal overhead**: Breakdown calculated during existing confidence computation
- **No extra passes**: Single analysis generates both score and breakdown
- **Efficient display**: Markdown rendering handled by VS Code

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Add confidence history (show how score changed over time)
- [ ] Suggest improvements ("Add more natural language to increase score")
- [ ] Interactive adjustments (click to exclude penalties)
- [ ] Per-project confidence calibration
- [ ] Export confidence reports

## Summary

The hover tooltip enhancement provides **complete transparency** into draft detection:

✅ **What**: Detailed confidence breakdown in hover tooltips  
✅ **Why**: Users understand exactly how scores are calculated  
✅ **How**: Visual indicators (🟢🟡⌨️📋✅⚠️💡) and structured markdown  
✅ **Impact**: Better user understanding, trust, and control  

Users can now see:
- Natural language percentage and contribution
- Incomplete LaTeX detection and bonus
- Multi-line detection and bonus
- Formatted LaTeX penalties
- Short text penalties
- Final score calculation with capping

This makes the "black box" of draft detection **completely transparent and understandable**! 🎯
