# Keybinding and Empty Line Filter Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Keybinding for Convert All Drafts

**New Keybinding:**
- **All platforms:** `Shift+Shift` (double tap Shift key)

**What it does:**
- Converts all detected draft sections to LaTeX
- Only active when editing LaTeX files
- Simple and fast - just double tap Shift!

**Implementation:**
Added to `package.json`:
```json
"keybindings": [
  {
    "command": "autotex.convertAllDrafts",
    "key": "shift+shift",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == latex"
  }
]
```

### 2. Smart Empty Line Filtering

**What changed:**
- Empty lines are filtered out **before sending to LLM**, not during detection
- This allows draft regions with empty lines between them to be properly detected and merged
- Prevents sending empty/whitespace-only content to the LLM

**Why this approach:**
- **Problem with early filtering:** If we filter empty lines during detection, we split up draft regions that should be merged together
- **Solution:** Detect all regions (including those with empty lines), merge them, then filter empty content right before LLM conversion

**Implementation:**
Added filtering in `src/inputMonitor.ts` (right before LLM call):
```typescript
// Skip if text is empty or only whitespace (important: check this right before conversion)
if (draft.text.trim().length === 0) {
    continue;
}
```

**Example:**
```
need to add proof here

basically use induction

the base case is trivial
```

- **Old approach:** Would detect 3 separate regions (split by empty lines)
- **New approach:** Detects as 1 merged region, then verifies it's not empty before sending to LLM

## New Workflow

### Before:
```
1. Type draft text
2. Press Enter
3. Press Enter again
4. Press Enter a third time
5. Wait for conversion
```

### Now:
```
1. Type draft text
2. Double tap Shift
3. Done!
```

## Benefits

### 1. Faster Conversion
- Double tap Shift - simple and fast!
- More intuitive than pressing Enter 3 times
- Works on all platforms the same way

### 2. Proper Draft Region Merging
- Drafts with empty lines between them are properly detected as one region
- No splitting of related content
- Better context for LLM conversion

### 3. Smart Empty Line Filtering
- Empty lines don't break draft detection
- Filtered right before sending to LLM
- No wasted API calls for empty content

### 4. Better UX
- Intuitive double-tap gesture
- Works only in LaTeX files (context-aware)
- Can be customized by user if desired

## Testing

### Test the Keybinding:

1. **Open a LaTeX file and save it** (Cmd/Ctrl+S)
2. **Type some draft text:**
   ```
   need to add proof here
   basically use induction
   ```
3. **Double tap Shift** (press Shift twice quickly)
4. **Verify:** All drafts should convert to LaTeX

### Test Empty Line Filtering and Merging:

1. **Save a LaTeX file**
2. **Type draft with empty lines between paragraphs:**
   ```
   need to add proof here
   
   basically use induction on n
   
   the base case is trivial
   ```
3. **Verify:** All text is highlighted as ONE draft region (not split into 3)
4. **Double tap Shift** to convert
5. **Verify:** The entire section is sent to LLM as one cohesive draft (empty lines don't split it)

## Documentation Updated

Updated files:
- `README.md` - Added keybinding to commands list
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Updated quick start and keyboard workflow
- `package.json` - Added keybindings section

## Configuration

Users can customize the keybinding in VS Code settings if desired:

1. Open **Keyboard Shortcuts** (Cmd/Ctrl+K, Cmd/Ctrl+S)
2. Search for "AutoTeX: Convert All Drafts"
3. Click the pencil icon to change the keybinding

## Notes

- The Enter 3 times trigger still works if users prefer it
- Keybinding only activates when:
  - Editor has focus (`editorTextFocus`)
  - Current file is LaTeX (`editorLangId == latex`)
- Empty line filtering improves performance by reducing unnecessary processing
