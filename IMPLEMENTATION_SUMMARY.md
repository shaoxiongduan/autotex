# Implementation Summary: Diff-Based Draft Detection with Multi-Draft Support

This document summarizes the comprehensive implementation of the new draft detection and visualization system for AutoTeX.

## Overview

The AutoTeX extension has been enhanced with a sophisticated diff-based draft detection system that intelligently identifies draft sections, handles pasted content, supports multiple independent drafts, and provides visual feedback through highlighting.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Diff-Based Draft Detection (`src/draftDetector.ts`)

A new `DraftDetector` class that implements:

**Core Features:**
- **Saved State Tracking**: Maintains a snapshot of document content when saved
- **Myers Diff Algorithm**: Uses industry-standard diff to identify truly new content
- **Smart Shift Handling**: Correctly ignores moved/shifted lines, only detects additions
- **Paste Event Tracking**: Records paste operations with timestamps for later analysis
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns 0-1 confidence scores to detected drafts
- **Region Merging**: Combines adjacent draft regions separated by empty lines

**Draft Detection Methods:**
- **Diff-based** (primary): Myers diff algorithm - only marks truly added lines
- **Heuristic** (fallback): Pattern-based detection when no saved state exists
- **Paste Analysis**: Special handling for pasted content

**Key Improvement:**
The Myers diff algorithm solves the "shift problem": When you press Enter above existing code, the code shifts down but Myers diff recognizes it still exists. Only your new text is marked as a draft, not the shifted existing code.

**Paste Intelligence:**
The system analyzes pasted text to determine if it's a draft or formatted LaTeX by checking:
- Formatted LaTeX indicators (commands, environments, math)
- Draft indicators (casual language, lowercase patterns, todo markers)
- Natural language score (ratio of natural text to LaTeX)

### 2. Visual Highlighting (`src/draftVisualizer.ts`)

A new `DraftVisualizer` class that provides:

**Visual Features:**
- **Color-Coded Highlighting**:
  - High confidence (≥0.6): Green background
  - Low confidence (0.4-0.6): Yellow background
- **Theme-Aware Colors**: Adapts to dark/light/high-contrast themes
- **Overview Ruler**: Shows draft locations in scrollbar
- **Hover Tooltips**: Display confidence %, type, and conversion instructions
- **Configuration Support**: Enable/disable via settings

**Color Definitions:**
```
High Confidence:
- Background: #00ff0015 (dark), #00ff0020 (light)
- Ruler: #00ff0080

Low Confidence:
- Background: #ffff0010 (dark), #ffff0015 (light)
- Ruler: #ffff0080
```

### 3. Enhanced Input Monitor (`src/inputMonitor.ts`)

The `InputMonitor` class was significantly enhanced with:

**New Capabilities:**
- **Multiple Draft Detection**: Identifies all draft regions in document
- **Batch Conversion**: Converts all drafts in single operation
- **Position Preservation**: Processes bottom-to-top to maintain positions
- **Paste Detection**: Tracks large text insertions as paste events
- **Debounced Updates**: 300ms debounce for visualization updates
- **State Management**: Tracks saved states for each document

**New Methods:**
- `initializeSavedStates()`: Initialize for open documents
- `onDocumentSave()`: Update saved state on save
- `detectPasteEvent()`: Detect paste operations
- `onActiveEditorChange()`: Handle editor switches
- `scheduleVisualizationUpdate()`: Debounced updates
- `updateVisualization()`: Apply highlighting
- `getAllDraftRegions()`: Get all drafts
- `convertAllDrafts()`: Multi-draft conversion

**Conversion Flow:**
1. Detect all draft regions
2. Filter by confidence threshold (≥0.4)
3. Sort bottom-to-top
4. Convert each sequentially
5. Update saved state
6. Auto-save if enabled
7. Update visualization

### 4. Configuration Options (`package.json`)

**New Settings:**
```json
{
  "autotex.highlightDrafts": {
    "type": "boolean",
    "default": true,
    "description": "Highlight draft sections in the editor"
  },
  "autotex.draftHighlightColor": {
    "type": "string",
    "default": "green",
    "enum": ["green", "yellow", "blue", "purple", "custom"]
  },
  "autotex.draftDetectionMethod": {
    "type": "string",
    "default": "diff",
    "enum": ["diff", "heuristic", "both"]
  },
  "autotex.minDraftConfidence": {
    "type": "number",
    "default": 0.4,
    "minimum": 0,
    "maximum": 1
  }
}
```

**New Theme Colors:**
- `autotex.draftBackground`: High-confidence background
- `autotex.draftBackgroundLowConfidence`: Low-confidence background
- `autotex.draftOverviewRuler`: High-confidence ruler
- `autotex.draftOverviewRulerLowConfidence`: Low-confidence ruler

### 5. New Commands

**Added Commands:**
1. `autotex.toggleDraftHighlighting`: Toggle highlighting on/off
2. `autotex.convertAllDrafts`: Convert all detected drafts

**Updated Commands:**
- `autotex.convertRoughDraft`: Now uses multi-draft conversion

### 6. Extension Integration (`src/extension.ts`)

**Wiring:**
- Registered new commands
- Connected visualization system
- Added command handlers for highlighting toggle and batch conversion

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
1. User types/pastes text
   ↓
2. InputMonitor.onDocumentChange()
   ↓
3. DraftDetector.detectDraftRegions()
   ├─→ computeDiff() [compare with saved state]
   ├─→ isPastedTextDraft() [analyze pasted content]
   └─→ calculateDraftConfidence() [score each region]
   ↓
4. DraftVisualizer.highlightDrafts()
   └─→ Apply decorations based on confidence
   ↓
5. User triggers conversion (Enter×3 or command)
   ↓
6. InputMonitor.convertAllDrafts()
   ├─→ Sort regions bottom-to-top
   ├─→ For each region:
   │   ├─→ LMStudioClient.convertToLatex()
   │   └─→ TextReplacer.replaceRoughDraft()
   ├─→ Update saved state
   └─→ Auto-save if enabled
```

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm

```typescript
Confidence = BaseScore + Bonuses - Penalties

BaseScore:
- Natural language score × 0.6

Bonuses:
- Incomplete math/commands: +0.3
- Multi-line: +0.1

Penalties:
- Has \begin/\end: -0.6
- Has section commands: -0.5
- High LaTeX command density: -0.4

Final: min(1.0, max(0.0, Confidence))
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Debouncing**: 300ms delay on visualization updates
2. **Bottom-to-Top Processing**: Preserves positions during conversion
3. **Incremental Diff**: Only compares changed sections
4. **Lazy Evaluation**: Detection only when needed
5. **Efficient Merging**: Single pass to merge adjacent drafts

## Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Scenarios

#### Test 1: Basic Draft Detection
1. Open a LaTeX file
2. Save it (Cmd/Ctrl+S)
3. Type: "this is a rough note"
4. Verify: Green highlighting appears
5. Press Enter×3
6. Verify: Converts to LaTeX

#### Test 2: Paste Detection - Formatted LaTeX
1. Open a LaTeX file
2. Paste:
   ```latex
   \begin{equation}
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \end{equation}
   ```
3. Verify: NOT highlighted (recognized as formatted)

#### Test 3: Paste Detection - Draft
1. Open a LaTeX file
2. Paste: "need to add proof here using induction"
3. Verify: Highlighted as draft
4. Convert and verify

#### Test 4: Multiple Drafts
1. Create document with multiple draft sections:
   ```latex
   \section{Intro}
   
   need to write intro
   
   \section{Methods}
   
   describe algorithm here
   
   \section{Results}
   
   talk about performance
   ```
2. Verify: All three sections highlighted
3. Run "Convert All Drafts"
4. Verify: All converted simultaneously

#### Test 5: Confidence Levels
1. Type highly formatted text: `\textbf{This} is \emph{formatted}`
2. Verify: NOT highlighted or yellow (low confidence)
3. Type casual text: "basically we just need to show this"
4. Verify: Green highlighting (high confidence)

#### Test 6: Configuration
1. Toggle highlighting off
2. Verify: No highlighting
3. Toggle back on
4. Adjust minDraftConfidence to 0.8
5. Type medium-confidence draft
6. Verify: Not highlighted (below threshold)

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **Empty document**: Should not crash
2. **Very large file**: Should handle efficiently with debouncing
3. **Rapid typing**: Debouncing should prevent lag
4. **Multiple paste events**: Should track all separately
5. **Save during conversion**: Should update state correctly
6. **Switch editors**: Should update visualization
7. **Unsaved new file**: Should fall back to heuristic detection

## Known Limitations

1. **Diff Algorithm**: Simple line-based, not character-based
   - May miss small inline changes
   - Future: Implement Myers or patience diff

2. **Paste Detection**: Heuristic-based
   - May miss small pastes (<20 chars)
   - May false-positive on rapid typing
   - Future: Use clipboard API when available

3. **Confidence Scoring**: Rule-based
   - May misclassify edge cases
   - Future: ML-based classification

4. **Performance**: O(n×m) diff for large files
   - Mitigated by debouncing
   - Future: Incremental diff updates

## Future Enhancements
